## Files Created

This repository now includes SEO optimization files:

1. **sitemap.xml** - XML sitemap containing all pages on the website
2. **robots.txt** - Tells search engines where to find the sitemap

## How to Submit Sitemap to Google Search Console

### Step 1: Access Google Search Console
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Add your property (imran-siddique.github.io) if not already added

### Step 2: Submit the Sitemap
1. In the left sidebar, click on **"Sitemaps"**
2. In the "Add a new sitemap" field, enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**

### Step 3: Verify Submission
- Google will start processing the sitemap
- You can check the status in the Sitemaps report
- It may take a few days for Google to crawl all pages

## Sitemap Contains

The sitemap includes the following 5 pages:
- Homepage (/)
- About page
- Projects page
- Writings page
- Contact page

## robots.txt

The robots.txt file tells search engines:
- All pages are allowed to be crawled
- The sitemap location is at: https://imran-siddique.github.io/sitemap.xml

## Maintenance

1. Add the new URL to sitemap.xml
